# Neptune Computational Biology - Final Project

## Guidelines - you can delete this section before submission

This repository is a stub for your final project. Fork it, develop your project, and submit it as a pull request. Edit/ delete the text in this readme as needed.

Some guidelines and tips:

- Use the stubs below to write up your final project.

- For information on formatting text files with markdown, see https://guides.github.com/features/mastering-markdown/ . You can use markdown to include images in this document by linking to files in the repository, eg `![Figure 1](./Figure1.png?raw=true)`.

- The project must be entirely reproducible. In addition to the results, the repository must include all the data (or links to data) and code needed to reproduce the results.

- If you are working with unpublished data that you would prefer not to publicly share at this time, please contact me to discuss options. In most cases, the data can be anonymized in a way that putting them in a public repo does not compromise your other goals.

- Paste references (including urls) into the reference section, and cite them with the general format (Smith at al. 2003).

- Commit and push often as you work.

OK, here we go.

# Combining trees

## Introduction and Goals

The question I want to answer is whether we can create more robust phylogenies by combining
morphological and mollecular data in the same analysis. Separate analysis can be run for
both the molecular and morphological data and compared with the combined phylogeny.

The methods I will use to do this are basic methods of data input and manipulation. Morphological data will be input as text files,
using regular expressions and data wrangling to make data easier to work with.
Molecular data will be formated similarly and emphasis will be given in processing the data and
producing data matrixes/matrix probably using a dictionary of strings. 
After formatting of the data files sepparately we will combine them and concatinate the various matrixes to use them in the tree producing software "Tree"
for input in a phylogenetic program.

The data I will use are partly simulation and possibly publicly available. I plan to have a small test data sample of 4 spieces and if that proves succesful we can expand and input more data in the code we produced.
