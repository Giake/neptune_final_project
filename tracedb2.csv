L. Cam. Interval B Mickwitzia SS:Lugnås, Kinekulle and Billinge:C.rusoformis:olenellacean trilobite:Jensen 1997:Straight or gently curved traces with two parallel lobes, each possesing sharp ridges, separated by a median furrow. Lobes in contact or in shallow forms sepparated by a medial platform. Ridges straight or a bit curved meeting at an angle 120 to 180 degrees.:  ::Jensen 1997 (thesis)::: 
L. Cam. Interval B and D Kinekulle:Also Billinge and Lugnås:C.tenella (Linnarsson 1871):palaeozoic forms - juvenile trilobite (Seilacher 1953):Jensen 1997:Small Cruziana with nearly transverse striation in some specimens paired. Parallel lobes with a central groove. Mostly straight burrow. Vertical undulation apparent. Width smaller than 3-5mm. Occasionally the trace is a series of sepparated lobes thus integrating in Rusophyce eutendorfensis:  ::Jensen 1997 (thesis):Fraena tenella (Linnarsson 1871) (Tromelin and Lebesconte 1876 made Fraena restricted to unilobate traces):C tenella vs Isopodichnus the later attributed commonly to freshwater bilobed traces. A diagnostic feature is its small size. Problems arise when comparing with traces made by a molluscan foot:

L. Cam. Mickwitzia SS:Västergötland, Sweden:R.dispar, Linnarsson, 1869:::Bidirectional scratches important feature. Equal width and length in most cases, bilobate burrows with heart shaped or oval outline. As burrows grow deeper length can be greater than width. Lobes strongly convex with steep sides and a pronounced median furrow. The lobes have transverse ridges at the deepest part of the trace and proverse and retroverse ridges at the anterior and posterior part respectively. 4 to 5 claws can be seen on the proverse markings. Scratches are thickly situated and often paired.:  ::Jensen 1997 (thesis):C.dispar:Looks like a combined Cruziana and Rusophycus. The headshield imprints on some of them point out that it was made by at least two different positions of the animal and directions of leg strokes.

L. Cam.:Hjälmsäter, Mick.SS and L.Cam. Alberta Canada:R.jenningsi::Fenton and Fenton, 1937 (Canada):Deep abrupt burrow with a U shape. Strong vertical prophile. Deepest part with apparent median furrow which divides the trace in two lobes and thus puts it in rusophyciform interpretation.Lobe ornamentation includes poorly preserved coarse scratch marks with finer scratch marks appearing towards one end of the specimen (possibly anterior).:  ::Jensen 1997 (thesis): :: 
L. Cam.:North West and North Greenland, Buen Formation:R.marginatus:Olenellus, Buenellus, tirlobite that could roll (anterior arch):Bergström and Peel 1988:Most specimens rusophyciform a few band shaped cruzianaform. The border of the head shield clearly visible in all occurences:  ::Bergström and Peel 1988: :Pay attention and find these specimens asap the cruzianaeform R.marginatus i believe will hold interesting information on the formation of Cruziana as the impression of the headshield and the oppening V scratches possibly do not agree with current interpretations of Cruziana making.: 
L. Cam.:North West and North Greenland, Dallas Bugt Form.:C.cf.c.dispar::Bergström and Peel 1988:Coars scratches made by walking legs. The scratches form an angle of 70 to 90 degrees to the midline of the specimen. Close to the end of the short traces the angles can be smaller reaching 60 degrees. Cruzianaeform and rusophyciform variants occur.:  ::Bergström and Peel 1988: :Equal distribution of cruzianaeform and rusophyciform traces. Coarse transverves scratches typical of arthropod biramous limb activity, heavyli overlapping scratches. Indistinguishable from C.dispar, Linnarsson (1869):

Better check that for possible producer associations and reference for functional studies.
